# Email Invitation Quick Fix Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The "Unexpected end of JSON input" error has been resolved. The application now:

- ✅ **Gracefully handles email failures** - No more crashes
- ✅ **Still creates invites** - Even if email fails
- ✅ **Provides manual invite links** - Copy and send manually
- ✅ **Better error messages** - Clear explanation of what happened

## 📋 How It Works Now

### When You Send an Invite:

**If email service is not configured or fails:**
1. ✅ Invite is created successfully
2. ⚠️ Email sending fails (gracefully)
3. 📋 You see: "✅ Invite created successfully! However, email sending failed..."
4. 🔗 Copy the invite link from "Pending Invites" section
5. 📧 Send it manually via your own email

**If email service is configured and working:**
1. ✅ Invite is created successfully
2. ✅ Email is sent automatically
3. 🎉 User receives invitation email

## 🔗 Manual Invite Process

### Step 1: Send Invite
- Click "Add User" or "Send Invite"

### Step 2: Copy Link
