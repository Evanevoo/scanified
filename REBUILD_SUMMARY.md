## 🔄 What Was Fixed

### Organization Deletion Service:
**Before:**
- Marked users as `deleted_at`
- Users couldn't reuse email addresses
- Confusing restore process

**After:**
- **PERMANENTLY DELETES** user profiles
- Emails can be reused immediately
- Restored organizations require new user emails
- Clear, simple logic

**Code Changed:**
```javascript
// OLD: Mark as deleted
.update({ deleted_at: new Date().toISOString() })

// NEW: Permanently delete
.delete()
```

### Navigation & Links:
**Updated All These:**
- Landing page "Start Free Trial" → `/create-organization`
- Landing page "Create Organization" → `/create-organization`
- OAuthOrganizationLink "Create Organization" → `/create-organization`
- CTABanner `primaryActionUrl` → `/create-organization`
