- **Function**: Provides overview and quick access to format configuration
- **User Experience**: Clear explanation of where to find format settings

### **⚙️ Settings Page** (`/settings` → Barcodes Tab)
- **Purpose**: **Primary location** for all format configuration
- **Features**: 
  - Barcode format patterns
  - Order number format rules  
  - Serial number validation
  - Pattern testing and validation
- **Function**: Actual configuration interface with save/load capabilities
