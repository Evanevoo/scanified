# Mobile App Organization Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Summary
The log message "No organization found, skipping customer fetch" was appearing because:

1. **2 users were authenticated but had no organization associated with their profiles**
2. **1 user had an invalid organization_id reference** (pointing to a non-existent organization)
3. **0 organizations existed in the database** (all were likely deleted or never created)

## Root Cause
- Users were able to authenticate but their profiles weren't properly linked to organizations
- This caused the mobile app to fail silently when trying to fetch organization-specific data
- The app would show "No organization found" logs but continue running, leading to empty screens

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- **ScanCylindersScreen.tsx**: Added better logging and user-friendly error messages
- **HomeScreen.tsx**: Improved error handling for customer search, bottle search, stats fetch, and unread count
- **useAuth.ts**: Added detailed logging to help debug authentication issues

### 2. User-Friendly Error Screen
- **App.tsx**: Added a dedicated error screen for users without organizations
- Shows clear explanation of the issue and provides a "Sign Out" button
- Prevents users from getting stuck in a broken state

### 3. Database Cleanup
- **cleanup-profiles.js**: Removed invalid organization_id references
- **debug-organization.js**: Created diagnostic tools to identify issues
- Fixed the immediate problem by cleaning up orphaned profile references

## Current State
✅ **2 users now have clean profiles** (no invalid organization_id references)
✅ **Mobile app will show proper error screen** instead of silent failures
✅ **Better logging** for debugging future issues
✅ **User-friendly error messages** explaining what went wrong

## Next Steps for Users

### For Users Without Organizations:
1. **Contact Administrator**: Ask to be assigned to an organization
2. **Create New Organization**: Use the web registration at https://www.scanified.com/register
3. **Sign Out**: Use the "Sign Out" button in the error screen to try a different account

### For Administrators:
1. **Create Organizations**: Use the Owner Portal to create organizations
2. **Assign Users**: Link existing users to organizations through the database
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check for similar issues in the future
