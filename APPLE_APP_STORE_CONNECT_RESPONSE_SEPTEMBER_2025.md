## üì± **Response to Review Issues**

### **Issue 1: Guideline 2.3.10 - Performance - Accurate Metadata**

**Apple's Feedback:**
> "The app or metadata includes information about third-party platforms that may not be relevant for App Store users, who are focused on experiences offered by the app itself. Revise the app's description to remove Android references."

3. **Code Verification:**
   - ‚úÖ No Android references in TypeScript/React Native code

### **Issue 2: Guideline 3.1.1 - Business - Payments - In-App Purchase**

> "The app includes an account registration feature for businesses and organizations, which is considered access to external mechanisms for purchases or subscriptions to be used in the app."

**‚úÖ RESOLUTION:**

   >
     <Ionicons name="mail" size={20} color="#fff" />
     <Text style={styles.createButtonText}>Contact Us</Text>
   </TouchableOpacity>
   ```
