# Forced Return Exception - Business Logic Documentation

## Overview
The "Forced Return From Previous Customer" exception is a critical data validation rule that detects bottle assignment conflicts during import processing.

## Business Rule

### When This Exception Triggers:
The exception **"Forced Return From Previous Customer: [CUSTOMER NAME] ([CUSTOMER ID])"** appears when:

1. **Database Records**: A bottle is currently assigned to Customer A in the system
2. **Physical Reality**: We physically have the bottle (it was scanned/imported)  
3. **New Assignment**: We're trying to assign/deliver this bottle to Customer B (different customer)

### Example Scenario:
```
Database says: Bottle #6789123 ‚Üí INDUSTRIAL MACHINE & MFG INC
Import says:  Bottle #6789123 ‚Üí Competition Muffler & Shocks

Result: üö® EXCEPTION
"Forced Return From Previous Customer: INDUSTRIAL MACHINE & MFG INC (800005BE-1578330321A)"
```

## Why This Matters

### Data Integrity Issue:
- **Expected**: Bottle should be with Customer A
- **Reality**: We have the bottle and are giving it to Customer B
- **Problem**: There's a gap in our tracking - how did we get the bottle back?

### Business Impact:
1. **Missing Return Transaction**: Customer A may not have been properly billed/credited for returning the bottle
2. **Inventory Discrepancy**: Our records don't match physical inventory  
3. **Customer Relations**: Customer A might still expect to have this bottle
4. **Compliance Issues**: Regulatory requirements for asset tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Validation Process:
```javascript
// 1. Extract bottle identifiers from import
const barcode = asset.barcode || asset.barcode_number;
const newCustomer = asset.customer_name;

// 2. Query current assignment in database
const currentAssignment = await checkBottleAssignment(barcode);

// 3. Compare assignments
if (currentAssignment.customer !== newCustomer) {
  // Generate exception
  throw new ForcedReturnException({
    type: 'FORCED_RETURN',
    message: `Forced Return From Previous Customer: ${currentAssignment.customer} (${currentAssignment.customerId})`,
    severity: 'high'
  });
}
```

### Database Query:
```sql
SELECT 
  barcode_number,
  serial_number,
  assigned_customer,
  customer_name,
  "CustomerListID"  -- Quoted for PostgreSQL case sensitivity
FROM bottles 
WHERE barcode_number IN ('6789123', '6789124', '6789125')
   OR serial_number IN ('HP123456', '24D789012', 'HP987654');
-- Note: organization_id filtering handled automatically by RLS policies
```

### Multi-Tenant Architecture:
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Automatically filters by current user's organization
- **No Manual Filtering**: System works for ANY organization automatically
- **Database Level Security**: Impossible to see other organization's data

### PostgreSQL Case Sensitivity Fix:
- **Issue**: PostgreSQL converts unquoted mixed-case identifiers to lowercase
- **Solution**: Quote column names with mixed case: `"CustomerListID"`
- **Access**: Use bracket notation in JavaScript: `currentAssignment?.["CustomerListID"]`

## Exception Display

### UI Presentation:
```
Exceptions on this asset:

[EH] Forced Return From Previous Customer: INDUSTRIAL MACHINE & MFG INC (800005BE-1578330321A)
```

- **EH Badge**: Red badge indicating "Exception - High priority"
- **Full Message**: Shows exactly which customer should have the bottle
- **Customer ID**: Provides reference for lookup/resolution

## Resolution Actions

### For Operations Team:
1. **Verify Physical Bottle**: Confirm we actually have the bottle
2. **Check Return Records**: Look for missing return transaction from Customer A
3. **Contact Customer A**: Verify if they returned the bottle
4. **Create Return Entry**: If bottle was returned but not recorded, create the return transaction
5. **Proceed with Assignment**: After resolving the discrepancy, approve the new assignment

### For System Administrators:
1. **Investigate Data Source**: Check why import data doesn't match current assignments
2. **Review Import Process**: Ensure proper validation is happening
3. **Audit Trail**: Create audit entries for all resolution actions

## Related Features

### Status Indicators:
- **3 Unresolved Exceptions**: Count appears in import approval interface
- **Exception Expansion**: Click to view all exception details
- **Asset Table**: Red exception rows between asset entries

### Import Approval Actions:
- **Mark for Investigation**: Flag for manual review
- **Change Customer**: Correct the assignment if needed
- **Verify Record**: Approve after manual validation
- **Delete Record**: Remove if import was incorrect

## Best Practices

### Prevention:
1. **Regular Inventory Audits**: Ensure database matches physical inventory
2. **Proper Return Processing**: Always record bottle returns immediately
3. **Import Validation**: Validate data before importing
4. **Staff Training**: Train staff on exception resolution procedures

### Resolution:
1. **Don't Ignore**: Always investigate exceptions before approving
2. **Document Actions**: Record what was done to resolve each exception
3. **Update Systems**: Ensure resolution updates all relevant systems
4. **Follow Up**: Verify resolution didn't create new issues
