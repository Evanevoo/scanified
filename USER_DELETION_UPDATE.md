# User Deletion Update

## ✅ What Changed

Updated the User Management page (`/owner-portal/user-management`) to **permanently delete users from Supabase Auth** when they are deleted from the organization.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Before:
- Only deleted user from `profiles` table
- User could still sign in with same email
- User account remained in Supabase Auth

### After:
- **Permanently deletes user from Supabase Auth** using `supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser()`
- **Deletes user from profiles table**
- User **cannot sign in** with same email
- User **must create new account** to rejoin

## 📝 Code Changes

**File:** `src/pages/UserManagement.jsx`

**Function:** `handleDeleteUser()`

**New Logic:**
1. **Step 1:** Delete from Supabase Auth (`supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser()`)
2. **Step 2:** Delete from profiles table
3. **Graceful fallback:** If auth deletion fails (no admin privileges), still deletes profile

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Admin Privileges Required
The `supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser()` function requires **admin privileges** in Supabase. If your current user doesn't have admin privileges:

- The auth deletion will fail gracefully
- The profile deletion will still work
- You'll see a warning in the console
- The user will be removed from the organization but may still exist in auth

### To Enable Admin Privileges:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to Authentication > Users
3. Find your user account
4. Make sure it has admin privileges

Or add this to your Supabase RLS policies to allow admin operations.

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the New Deletion:
1. Go to `/owner-portal/user-management`
2. Find a test user
3. Click the delete (trash) icon
4. Confirm the deletion
5. **Expected Result:**
   - User is removed from the table
   - Success message: "User [email] has been PERMANENTLY DELETED from Supabase"
   - User cannot sign in with same email
   - User must create new account to rejoin

### Test Email Reuse:
1. Delete a user
2. Try to create new account with same email
3. **Expected Result:** Should work (email is freed up)

## 🎯 User Experience

### Confirmation Dialog:
**Old:** "Are you sure you want to remove [email] from your organization?"

**New:** "Are you sure you want to PERMANENTLY DELETE [email]? This will remove them from Supabase Auth and they will need to create a new account to rejoin."

### Success Message:
**Old:** "User removed from organization successfully!"

**New:** "User [email] has been PERMANENTLY DELETED from Supabase. They will need to create a new account to rejoin."

## 🔄 Consistency

This change makes individual user deletion consistent with organization deletion:

- **Organization Deletion:** Permanently deletes all users
- **Individual User Deletion:** Permanently deletes the specific user

Both operations now permanently remove users from Supabase Auth, allowing email addresses to be reused.

## ✅ Ready to Test

The change is complete and ready for testing. No additional setup required.

---

**This ensures that when you delete users from the User Management page, they are completely removed from Supabase and their email addresses can be reused immediately.**
