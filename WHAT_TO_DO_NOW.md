### ✨ NEW Features

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Email Verification** | Users verify email before organization is created |
| **Clean Invitations** | Simple, professional invitation system |
| **Permanent User Deletion** | When org is deleted, users are GONE (can reuse emails) |

## 📁 New Pages You Have

| URL | What It Does |
|-----|--------------|
| `/create-organization` | Create new organization (with email verification) |
| `/verify-organization` | Verify email and complete setup |
| `/user-invites` | Send and manage invitations |
| `/accept-invite` | Accept invitation and join organization |

---

## 🎯 Key Points

### Organization Deletion (IMPORTANT!)

When you delete an organization:
- ✅ Organization data is **soft deleted** (can be restored)
- ❌ All users are **PERMANENTLY DELETED**
- 📧 If you restore it, users need **NEW email addresses**

This is **exactly what you asked for**:
> "delete all the users associated with, and if the organazation want it back, they will need to provide new email for it."

### Email Verification (REQUIRED)

When creating an organization:
- ✅ User **must verify their email** first
- ✅ Link expires in **24 hours**
- ✅ Prevents spam and fake accounts

This is **exactly what you asked for**:
> "when creating an organazation, we must send a link to the email provided so we can verify for security reasons"
